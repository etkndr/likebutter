                <p>Andrew Kinder was born and raised in Knoxville. After years of working front of house positions, he joined a catering company where Philip was head chef and immediately felt at home. Eventually, he moved on to start his own food truck in Knoxville that grew in popularity year after year. Growing tired of the mobile aspect of the food truck business, he and his partners decided it was time to say goodbye to the truck, and he has now settled in to this new venture with Like Butter Catering.</p>
