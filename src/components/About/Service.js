                <p>At Like Butter, we are committed to serving simple food... just elevated a bit, with high-end cullinary practices and the freshest ingredients. Does your church have a large event coming up? We can handle that. Does your office have a company meeting tomorrow? We'll be there with lunch. Does that wedding or rehearsal dinner need a caterer? Not a problem! We could give so many more examples, but I think you get it. No matter what you needs or wants you have, we will be there for you!</p>
